<h1>Diary</h1>

<p>
<pre>
Every night, around 11:30, after the AC
is off and we've put the fans in the windows,
the smell of crepe myrtles floods the house.

It lasts about an hour, and then it's gone.

The crepe myrtles are indeed in bloom
right now, so it makes sense that I'd
notice their smell, I suppose, but I
haven't a clue why the fragrant intruder
bursts in on schedule and then runs off,
and Google is silent on the matter.

Come to think of it, the tree frogs have been
awfully loud most nights lately. Maybe they
solved my delicious mystery, and now they're
just itching to share their secret.
