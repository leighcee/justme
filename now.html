<h1>Now</h1>

<p>
<pre>
When I was young there were certain things that always felt like something
I assumed to be death:  Sunday afternoons, Granny's house at night, and
those particular summer days that seemed almost too wide for the living.

And, of course, your needless lies.

Even today their stench follows me, and I find myself in a stupor, from loathing.
