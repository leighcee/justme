<h1>Once</h1>
</header>
<p>
<pre>
I've begun looking to poetry (again) in a half-hopeful 
effort to find something that I lost a long time ago.

I make no claim of being a real poet.

I deplore speaking cryptically, and I don't have 
the kind of passion that would enable me to write 
in such a way that I could compare it to birth 
or death or sex or anything that <em>culminates</em> 
in some grand way.

But when everyone else in the house is asleep, and my fingers lie
questioningly upon the home row,

I can almost remember feeling young.
