<h1>Conundrum</h1>

<p>
<pre>
Sometimes, to love well, we must love less.  Annihilation of Self, when deemed necessary for GivingAllMyLove 
by the Loving One, is thus decreed for the Beloved, as well.  What remains but two Emptinessesâ€”the Lost Self 
and the Lost Self?  And I've seen Resentment and Guilt just as deftly rush in to fill one Emptiness as the other.
