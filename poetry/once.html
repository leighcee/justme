<h1>Once</h1>

<p>
<pre>
I've begun looking to poetry (again) in a half-hopeful 
effort to find something that I lost a long time ago.

I make no claim of being a real poet.

I deplore speaking cryptically, and I don't have the kind of passion 
that culminates in a beautiful agony 

or an agonizing beauty.

But when everyone else in the house is asleep, and my fingers lie
questioningly upon the home row,

I can almost remember feeling young.
