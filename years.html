Wide awake, I sit in bed, moving my toes 
in strange ways to pass the time.

I stop when it hits me that "passing the time" 
is a folly of modernity of which I should want no part.

So instead of playing audience to toe dances, I strain my ears 
to hear crickets, tree frogs, and katydids over the hum 
of the window fan.  I'm hopeful that their song will inspire me 
to something useful, or at least lull me to sleep.

I grab a pen and an old wrinkled sheet of notebook paper 
to scribble down some thoughts, but my eyes soon drift
away from the paper and back to my now-still feet.

I'm paralyzed by the gravity of this realization 
that I'm too old to have time for toe dances.
